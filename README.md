The Contact Management task involved developing a system using Java and Spring Boot that allows users to manage their contact information efficiently. The project required creating an application where users can perform essential operations such as adding, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts. The system was designed to store contact information either in memory or in a persistent storage format like a file or database.

The first step in this task was to design the application's architecture, ensuring that the system is scalable and maintainable. The project was structured into different layers, with a clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data access layers. This modular approach allows for easier updates and debugging in the future.

The application began by allowing users to add new contacts, requiring them to input details such as the contact's name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant information. The information was validated to ensure that only accurate and properly formatted data was stored. This was critical to maintaining the integrity of the contact data.

Next, the system was designed to display a list of all saved contacts, enabling users to easily view and search through their contact list. The list could be sorted and filtered based on different criteria, such as name or phone number, enhancing the usability of the application.

Editing functionality was also implemented, allowing users to update contact information as needed. This feature was crucial for maintaining up-to-date records, ensuring that users could correct any mistakes or update details as their contacts' information changed over time.

The delete function was carefully implemented to ensure that users could remove contacts from the system if they were no longer needed. This feature included confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions, adding a layer of security to the operation.

Throughout the development process, emphasis was placed on writing clean, scalable code that adheres to best practices in software development. Proper error handling was integrated to ensure that the application could handle unexpected situations gracefully, such as attempts to add duplicate contacts or invalid data entries.

The project also involved creating comprehensive documentation, which covered the design decisions, the functionality of each component, and instructions for deploying and maintaining the application. This documentation was essential for future developers or users who might need to work with or modify the system.

Overall, the Contact Management task was a valuable project that demonstrated the ability to create a functional, user-friendly application using modern Java and Spring Boot technologies. It showcased skills in full-stack development, data management, and the creation of intuitive user interfaces, all of which are critical for building robust and reliable software solutions.
